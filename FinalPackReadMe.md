## Summary -  

I learned a refreshing amount of things thanks to this class. It forced me to leave my comfort zone
and allowed me to not only learn new things but actually apply them with the help of our USB and
Raspberry pi. My favorite parts of the semester was the group project and the midterm script. With
the group project I got to work with my fellow students to learn about some awesome technology 
and then deploy it in our own enviornment. It's not every day you get a place to trial and error
all the things that you learn rather than just reading about them.
